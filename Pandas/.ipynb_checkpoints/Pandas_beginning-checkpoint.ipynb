    "A Pandas series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold many data types, such as numbers or strings. One of the main differences between Pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays is that you can assign an index label to each element in the Pandas Series. In other words, you can name the indices of your Pandas Series anything you want. Another big difference between Pandas Series and NumPy ndarrays is that Pandas Series can hold data of different data types."

    "One great advantage of Pandas Series is that it allows us to access data in many different ways. Elements can be accessed using index labels or numerical indices inside square brackets, [ ], similar to how we access elements in NumPy ndarrays. Since we can use numerical indices, we can use both positive and negative integers to access data from the beginning or from the end of the Series, respectively. Since we can access elements in various ways, in order to remove any ambiguity to whether we are referring to an index label or numerical index, Pandas Series have two attributes, **.loc and .iloc** to explicitly state what we mean. **The attribute .loc stands for location and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a labeled index. Similarly, the attribute .iloc stands for integer location and it is used to explicitly state that we are using a numerical index.** Let's see some examples:"
